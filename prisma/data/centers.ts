    description: `In his Inaugural Address in June 2011, Coming Together to Move Forward, then incoming University President, Fr. Joel E. Tabora SJ proposed that Ateneo de Davao University become the center of anthropological instruction and research in Mindanao.  To that end, he approved the creation of the Ateneo de Davao University Institute of Anthropology (AIA) in November 2011.

    The AIA is becoming a hub for anthropological scholarship that will enrich public understanding of the diverse and evolving cultures of Mindanao.  Since 2012, when it became fully operational, it has produced 12 major academic and policy studies; 6 of which were funded by the University Research Council, and 6 commissioned by outside organizations.  The institute’s research engagements also provide opportunities for partnership with local communities in addressing locally-relevant development issues.  Finally, the institute promotes anthropological knowledge through its core graduate degree program, and a number of undergraduate and graduate courses.  The graduate degree program, which awards a Master of Arts in Anthropology degree, administers the formation and training of critical thinkers who can apply anthropological analysis and methods in approaching community or development issues and problems, and thus contribute to the growth of Mindanao and its peoples.`,

    description: `Mindanao stays in the periphery of the Philippine nation-state – a recipient of a series of development paradigms, a battleground of contending armies, a frontier for natural resource exploitation and a limited participant to academic discourses. Together with old challenges, this also opens up new opportunities for the university to contribute to the growing importance of Mindanao. To participate in the discourses above, the Department of Political Science and History and International Studies created the Center for Politics, and International Affairs (CPIA).

    CPIA provides an avenue for scholars, researchers, alumni, faculty and students to pursue their interest in politics and establish important networks in Political Science and International Relations. Through CPIA we hope to carry Mindanaons’ voice in the national and international discourses. As a joint Department initiative, the center addresses socio-political domestic and international issues that concern the island of Mindanao. Its growing relevance dictates the emphasis on Mindanao in the country and the region.
    
    CPIA also aims to establish a pool of Mindanao political analysts who will address the needs of the university and the community as a whole, for an informed understanding and honest discussion of socio-political issues in the country and the world. The center will utilize an array of theoretical perspectives in informing the university and the nation through policy briefs, monographs, conference papers, forums, and newsletters. CPIA, therefore, aims to ignite the culture of discussion on the main issues and events that carry local, national or international importance.`,

    History. The University Publication Office evolved from the former Research and Publication Office (RPO), an office mandated to “serve as the center for the advancement of research culture in the University.” In 2011, the structure of RPO was changed upon the initiative of University President Fr. Joel E. Tabora who saw the need to make research a collective concern of the University, and not lodged in one office. Thus, the University Research Council (URC) was created, with RPO being renamed University Publication Office (UPO).UPO publishes academic, literary, and artistic works released under the imprint of the Ateneo de Davao University. It assists University units and offices as well as faculty members in publishing their research outputs.
